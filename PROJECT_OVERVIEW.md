# Project Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the backend project, explaining its purpose, architecture, current implementation status, and planned features.

## 1. Purpose

The backend project implements a flexible, LAN-only backend that:

- Streams AI-generated text or images to multiple client UIs (e.g., Kivy, PySide, web) over WebSockets.
- Centralizes all model and device settings in a single MCP (Model-Context Protocol) service, so inference parameters and home-automation commands are managed in one place.
- Supports multiple inference providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local LLM) and home-automation via Zigbee, with clean separation between components.

```
Client UIs  ─── WebSocket ──▶ Gateway ──▶ Router ──▶ Adapters ──▶ Providers/Zigbee
                       │            │
                       │            └──▶ MCP (config & profiles)

                   Metrics
```

**Gateway**: Accepts client connections, handles authentication, and frames WebSocket messages.

**Router**: Directs requests by fetching the correct settings from MCP, choosing the right adapter, and streaming results back to the client, including timeout and fallback logic.

**Adapters**: One per external system, translating between internal requests and provider APIs or device commands.

**MCP**: Single source of truth for model parameters, user profiles, device definitions, and chat history.

**Providers/Zigbee**: The actual AI services (e.g., OpenAI) and home-automation hub that carry out inference or device control.

## 6. Key Components

config.yaml: Holds all settings (gateway host/port, timeouts, logging configuration).

gateway/: Implements FastAPI WebSocket route with connection management; validates incoming frames and sends outgoing chunks. Currently includes `websocket.py` (FastAPI app) and `connection_manager.py` (WebSocket lifecycle management).

router/: Core logic for request orchestration, timeout handling, and streaming responses. Currently includes `request_router.py` (main orchestrator) and `message_types.py` (request/response models). **Note**: MCP integration and adapter coordination will be added when those services are implemented.

adapters/: **Planned directory** for modules (openai_adapter.py, anthropic_adapter.py, local_llm_adapter.py, zigbee_adapter.py) that will interface with each external system. Currently empty.

mcp/: **Planned directory** for Model-Context Protocol service following the latest MCP specification. Will use SQLite initially to store CRUD operations on model profiles, user and device settings, and chat history, and broadcast updates via pub/sub. Currently empty.

  • Aggregator: **Planned feature** to proxy/aggregate 100s of external MCP servers (e.g., context7, memorybank), with ON/OFF toggles and static config in config.yaml. Will broadcast updates from external MCPs with LLM-driven conflict resolution/schema handling.

common/: Houses Pydantic models (WebSocketResponse, Chunk, etc.), structured logging setup with TimedLogger, and the configuration loader that reads config.yaml and environment variables.

tests/: Organized to mirror src/, using pytest and pytest-asyncio for async components. Includes unit tests for config, models, gateway, and router components.

scripts/: `lint.sh` to run Ruff & Black, `start_dev.sh` to launch the application locally.

examples/: Contains `websocket_client.py` for testing WebSocket connections and `test_router_actions.py` for testing different action types.

## 7. Communication Protocols & Connections

## 7. Communication Protocols & Connections

### Current Implementation
**Client ↔ Gateway**: WebSockets for persistent, bidirectional streaming of text tokens or image bytes between UI and server.

**Gateway ↔ Router**: Direct function calls in single-process setup; designed for future gRPC distribution.

### Planned Protocols
**Router ↔ Adapters**: gRPC streams for converting internal request objects into provider-specific API streams and back.

**Router ↔ MCP**: RESTful HTTP/JSON (or gRPC for stricter contracts), keeping configuration human-readable and easy to debug.

**MCP Updates → Router**: Redis Pub/Sub channel for hot-reloading parameter changes without restarts.

**Adapters → Devices**: MQTT over TCP (via Zigbee2MQTT) at defined QoS levels for reliable home-automation delivery.

## 8. Current Working Implementation & Message Flow

The system now has a **production-ready implementation** with real OpenAI integration:

**Performance Architecture:**

*Real-Time Chat Streaming:*
1. User sends message → Frontend → WebSocket → Backend
2. Backend routes to selected AI provider (currently OpenAI)
3. Provider streams response chunks immediately (no accumulation)
4. Backend forwards each chunk instantly to frontend (<1ms delay)
5. Frontend receives real-time streaming text as it's generated

*Provider Architecture:*
1. **Unified Interface**: All providers implement standardized `BaseAdapter`
2. **Configuration-Driven**: Provider selection via config, inference params via MCP (future)
3. **High Performance**: Zero-delay chunk forwarding, no duplicate content
4. **Error Resilient**: Timeout handling, rate limiting, graceful degradation

*Future MCP Integration:*
1. Provider selection remains in config file (OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini choice)
2. All inference parameters migrate to MCP service (temperature, system prompts, etc.)
3. Tool/function definitions managed by MCP servers
4. Real-time parameter updates via Redis Pub/Sub

**Message Flow:**
1. Client connects to WebSocket endpoint: `ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws/chat`
2. Client sends chat action with text payload
3. Gateway validates and routes to Router
4. Router selects provider adapter (currently OpenAI)
5. Adapter streams real AI responses back through Gateway
6. Client receives immediate streaming responses (no mock data)

**Current Provider Support:**
- ✅ **OpenAI**: Production-ready with gpt-4o-mini, streaming optimization
- 🔄 **Anthropic**: Planned (Claude models)
- 🔄 **Google Gemini**: Planned (Gemini models)
- 🔄 **OpenRouter**: Planned (multi-model access)
- 🔄 **Local LLMs**: Planned (self-hosted models)

**Example Client Interaction:**
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws/chat');

// Real-time chat with OpenAI streaming
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
    action: "chat",
    payload: {text: "Tell me a joke"},
    request_id: "chat-123"
}));

// Receive real streaming response
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    const response = JSON.parse(event.data);
    if (response.status === 'chunk') {
        // Real OpenAI content streaming in real-time
        console.log(response.chunk.data); // "Why", " did", " the", " chicken..."
    }
};
```

**What's Working Now:**
✅ **Real AI Integration**: Live OpenAI API with streaming responses

## 10. Engineering Standards & Rules

### Implementation Principles
- **Pin interpreter version**: Never mix Python versions across environments
- **Dependency management**: Use `uv add` for dependencies; always commit lockfile
- **Async design**: Event-driven architecture; never block main thread
- **Single responsibility**: One purpose per file/class; avoid god classes
- **Security**: Never commit secrets; read from environment variables
- **Testing**: ≥ 40% test coverage on critical logic; lint/type-check in CI
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logs; no metrics endpoints in application
- **Performance**: Optimize only after profiling; set realistic SLOs
- **Error handling**: Fail fast on invalid input; catch broad exceptions only at process boundaries

### Code Quality Standards
- **Linting**: Ruff for fast Python linting
- **Formatting**: Black for consistent code style
- **Type checking**: mypy for static type analysis
- **Testing**: pytest with pytest-asyncio for async components
- **Pre-commit**: Automated quality checks before commits
