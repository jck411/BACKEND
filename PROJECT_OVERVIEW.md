# Project Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the backend project, explaining its purpose, architecture, current implementation status, and planned features.

## 1. Purpose

The backend project implements a flexible, LAN-only backend that:

- Streams AI-generated text or images to multiple client UIs (e.g., Kivy, PySide, web) over WebSockets.
- Centralizes all model and device settings in a single MCP (Model-Context Protocol) service, so inference parameters and home-automation commands are managed in one place.
- Supports multiple inference providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local LLM) and home-automation via Zigbee, with clean separation between components.

## 2. Features

### Current Implementation (v0.1 - Working Base)
- ✅ **WebSocket Gateway**: FastAPI-based streaming gateway with connection management
- ✅ **Request Router**: Request orchestration with timeout handling and response streaming
- ✅ **Structured Logging**: JSON logs with performance metrics and timing information
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Pydantic models with comprehensive validation
- ✅ **Automation Tools**: Pre-commit hooks, linting, testing infrastructure

## 4. High-Level Architecture

```
Client UIs  ─── WebSocket ──▶ Gateway ──▶ Router ──▶ Adapters ──▶ Providers/Zigbee
                       │            │
                       │            └──▶ MCP (config & profiles)

                   Logging
                   Metrics
```

**Gateway**: Accepts client connections, handles authentication, and frames WebSocket messages.

**Router**: Directs requests by fetching the correct settings from MCP, choosing the right adapter, and streaming results back to the client, including timeout and fallback logic.

**Adapters**: One per external system, translating between internal requests and provider APIs or device commands.

**MCP**: Single source of truth for model parameters, user profiles, device definitions, and chat history.

**Providers/Zigbee**: The actual AI services (e.g., OpenAI) and home-automation hub that carry out inference or device control.

## 6. Key Components

config.yaml: Holds all settings (gateway host/port, timeouts, logging configuration).

gateway/: Implements FastAPI WebSocket route with connection management; validates incoming frames and sends outgoing chunks. Currently includes `websocket.py` (FastAPI app) and `connection_manager.py` (WebSocket lifecycle management).

router/: Core logic for request orchestration, timeout handling, and streaming responses. Currently includes `request_router.py` (main orchestrator) and `message_types.py` (request/response models). **Note**: MCP integration and adapter coordination will be added when those services are implemented.

adapters/: **Planned directory** for modules (openai_adapter.py, anthropic_adapter.py, local_llm_adapter.py, zigbee_adapter.py) that will interface with each external system. Currently empty.

mcp/: **Planned directory** for Model-Context Protocol service following the latest MCP specification. Will use SQLite initially to store CRUD operations on model profiles, user and device settings, and chat history, and broadcast updates via pub/sub. Currently empty.

  • Aggregator: **Planned feature** to proxy/aggregate 100s of external MCP servers (e.g., context7, memorybank), with ON/OFF toggles and static config in config.yaml. Will broadcast updates from external MCPs with LLM-driven conflict resolution/schema handling.

common/: Houses Pydantic models (WebSocketResponse, Chunk, etc.), structured logging setup with TimedLogger, and the configuration loader that reads config.yaml and environment variables.

tests/: Organized to mirror src/, using pytest and pytest-asyncio for async components. Includes unit tests for config, models, gateway, and router components.

scripts/: `lint.sh` to run Ruff & Black, `start_dev.sh` to launch the application locally.

examples/: Contains `websocket_client.py` for testing WebSocket connections and `test_router_actions.py` for testing different action types.

## 7. Communication Protocols & Connections

## 7. Communication Protocols & Connections

### Current Implementation
**Client ↔ Gateway**: WebSockets for persistent, bidirectional streaming of text tokens or image bytes between UI and server.

**Gateway ↔ Router**: Direct function calls in single-process setup; designed for future gRPC distribution.

### Planned Protocols
**Router ↔ Adapters**: gRPC streams for converting internal request objects into provider-specific API streams and back.

**Router ↔ MCP**: RESTful HTTP/JSON (or gRPC for stricter contracts), keeping configuration human-readable and easy to debug.

**MCP Updates → Router**: Redis Pub/Sub channel for hot-reloading parameter changes without restarts.

**Adapters → Devices**: MQTT over TCP (via Zigbee2MQTT) at defined QoS levels for reliable home-automation delivery.

## 8. Current Working Implementation & Message Flow

The system now has a working bare-bones implementation with Router integration:

**Architecture Clarification:**

*Device Control Flow:*
1. User: "Turn on the lights" → Frontend → WebSocket → Backend
2. Backend LLM processes request and calls device functions directly
3. Backend executes device commands via Zigbee adapter
4. Backend sends status update to frontend: "Lights turned on"
5. Frontend displays confirmation to user

*Audio Streaming Flow:*
1. Backend generates TTS audio data
2. Backend streams audio chunks to frontend via WebSocket
3. Frontend plays audio in real-time
4. Supports various audio formats and voice configurations

*Frontend Command Flow:*
1. Backend determines UI updates needed (notifications, status displays)
2. Backend sends frontend_command actions to update UI
3. Frontend handles display logic and user experience

**Message Flow:**
1. Client connects to WebSocket endpoint: `ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws/chat`
2. Client sends action message with proper payload structure
3. Gateway parses message and routes to Router
4. Router processes request type and executes appropriate backend logic
5. Router streams chunked responses back through Gateway
6. Client receives real-time streaming responses

**Supported Actions:**
- `chat`: Text generation/conversation with LLM function calling for device control
- `generate_image`: Image generation requests (placeholder responses)
- `audio_stream`: Audio data streaming for TTS/speech synthesis
- `frontend_command`: UI-specific commands (notifications, display updates, etc.)

**Example Client Interaction:**
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws/chat');

// Text chat with potential device control via LLM function calling
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
    action: "chat",
    payload: {text: "Turn on the living room lights and tell me about the weather"},
    request_id: "chat-123"
}));

// Audio streaming for TTS output
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
    action: "audio_stream",
    payload: {text: "Hello, this will be converted to speech", voice: "en-US-male"},
    request_id: "audio-456"
}));

// Frontend-specific commands (notifications, UI updates)
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
    action: "frontend_command",
    payload: {command: "show_notification", data: {message: "Device status updated"}},
    request_id: "ui-789"
}));
```

**What's Working:**
✅ FastAPI WebSocket Gateway with connection management
✅ Router with request orchestration and timeout handling
✅ Structured JSON logging with performance timing
✅ Type-safe message validation with Pydantic
✅ Real-time response streaming to client
✅ Pre-commit hooks for code quality
✅ Proper architecture separation: backend handles device control via LLM function calling
✅ Audio streaming capability for TTS and voice synthesis
✅ Frontend command system for UI updates and notifications

**Architecture Principles:**
- Device control happens on backend via LLM function calling, not frontend execution
- Audio streaming flows from backend to frontend for TTS/speech synthesis
- Frontend receives display commands and notifications, handles UI/UX
- Clear separation of concerns: backend for intelligence, frontend for presentation

## 10. Engineering Standards & Rules

### Implementation Principles
- **Pin interpreter version**: Never mix Python versions across environments
- **Dependency management**: Use `uv add` for dependencies; always commit lockfile
- **Async design**: Event-driven architecture; never block main thread
- **Single responsibility**: One purpose per file/class; avoid god classes
- **Security**: Never commit secrets; read from environment variables
- **Testing**: ≥ 40% test coverage on critical logic; lint/type-check in CI
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logs; no metrics endpoints in application
- **Performance**: Optimize only after profiling; set realistic SLOs
- **Error handling**: Fail fast on invalid input; catch broad exceptions only at process boundaries

### Code Quality Standards
- **Linting**: Ruff for fast Python linting
- **Formatting**: Black for consistent code style
- **Type checking**: mypy for static type analysis
- **Testing**: pytest with pytest-asyncio for async components
- **Pre-commit**: Automated quality checks before commits
